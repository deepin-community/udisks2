  Ship a udev rules files named 70-insecure-fs.rules which sets the udev
  property UDISKS_AUTO to 0 for file systems that are marked as "Orphan"
  or "Odd Fixes" in the kernel MAINTAINERS file. Those are more at risk of
  having security-sensitive defects which could be exploited by a crafted
  file system.
  .
  The list includes the following file systems:
  affs, ecryptfs, efs, hfs, hfsplus, jffs2, jfs, qnx6, sysv.
